harryjsisson,1692580276000,,,,,,,"üö®Since Republicans continue to lie about President Biden‚Äôs response to the Hawaii wildfires, he‚Äôs a new updated list of what his administration has done via the White House: 

‚Ä¢As of Saturday, August 19, there are more than 1,000 federal personnel on the ground in Maui assisting residents in their greatest time of need, including more than 450 search and rescue team members.

‚Ä¢To date, the Biden-Harris Administration has approved nearly $7 million in assistance to nearly 2,200 households, including nearly $3 million in initial rental assistance.¬†

‚Ä¢FEMA has made available more than 50,000 meals, 75,000 liters of water, 5,000 cots and 10,000 blankets and shelter supplies to the county government for distribution.

‚Ä¢   The number of survivors in congregate shelters was reduced by 50% on Thursday. The Red Cross expects to move all survivors who are still in shelters into hotel rooms by next week.

‚Ä¢On Wednesday, President Biden made additional disaster funding available to the state of Hawaii.

‚Ä¢More than 600 personnel from the Department of Defense and 140 members of the Coast Guard are actively participating in the coordinated response to the Western Maui Wildfire.¬†

‚Ä¢The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has deployed 54 responders, 16 remote personnel, and 41 contractors who are assisting with public works and engineering support. 

‚Ä¢The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has deployed 47 responders to Maui following the Hawaii wildfires and has a full incident command team on the ground working closely with FEMA and other federal, state, and local partners.

‚Ä¢The Department of Energy has deployed emergency responders to support the Federal response to the wildfires in Maui.

‚Ä¢The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) deployed 85 responders from ASPR, including experts from the National Disaster Medical System‚Äôs Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team and a Victim Identification Center team to assist Maui County with victim identification.

‚Ä¢The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has more than 30 staff on the ground in Hawaii and are phasing in more. Survivors and businesses who register for FEMA assistance, will also be eligible for low-interest disaster loans.

‚Ä¢The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service approved waivers,¬†which will allow SNAP households in Hawaii, including on Maui, to purchase hot foods with SNAP benefits through September 14; allow package size flexibility for those using the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program through October 31 so they have more options to purchase what is available; and allow parents or guardians to pick up meals for children at grab ‚Äòn go sites.

‚Ä¢The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing a 90-day relief from foreclosures of Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages and home equity conversion mortgages.

‚Ä¢The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has created a disaster and emergencies guide to handling finances, including resources to help impacted residents recover, such as tackling housing issues, protecting your finances, dealing with property damage, managing your bills, and asking for help from financial companies like banks, credit cards and other lenders.

‚Ä¢The U.S. Department of Transportation currently has three temporary flight restrictions in place to help facilitate search and rescue missions and has worked with major U.S. airlines that serve Kahului Airport to promote flexible travel policies.

‚Ä¢The Heritage Emergency National Task Force (HENTF), a partnership between FEMA and Smithsonian Institution, is in contact with the National Heritage Responders: Hawaii cultural heritage emergency network.

My hotel is 45 minutes from Lahaina.

‚Äå
If You Don‚Äôt Believe The Maui, Lahaina, Hawaii Fires Were Caused By DEWs (Direct Energy Weapons) Already, You Will Now
‚Äå
ANTARCTICA: ‚ÄúAtmospheric Research Observatory I witnessed myself a very powerful green laser shooting out of the top of this facility into the cosmos‚Äù
‚Äå
They informed me that all of my information will be recorded for public record and shared with Congress. It is that important. In 2010, I was selected to go down to the South Pole Station in Antarctica for an entire year by Raytheon Polar Services. As an employee of a third party contractor for the National Science Foundation, I functioned in a dual role capacity as a tradesman and a firefighter. My responsibilities required me to be more informed than most of my crew and offered me complete access to the facilities. What I learned from this unique experience needs to be shared with the entire world.
‚Äå
The technology at the South Pole Station certainly can do what it is presented as its primary purposes and unfortunately much more. The Ice Cube neutrino detector is presented as a passive listening device for the purposes of the science as presented, but I'm gonna skip right through the Chase folks.
‚Äå
Uh, I have provided documentation that proves that the 5,160, what they call doms, that are embedded in the ice, can actually transmit at 2047 volts each. That gives us a long list of things to consider. It is effectively a multifaceted directed energy weapons platform that I will, uh, list rapidly a few things that it can do. Vehicle detection. We're learning that these off world craft on world craft, ours or other nations are also emitting neutrinos.
‚Äå
So this makes the South Pole Station effectively an air traffic control station for this new level of equipment that nobody's discussing. In addition to the ability to detect neutrinos and the exotic vehicles, I provided documentation that shows that this is also a system for faster than light communications. In the past, Gary McKinnon has hacked, NASA found the off world fleet, the list of captains, and it's apparent that if we have faster than light vehicles moving throughout the system, we're gonna need faster than light communications.
‚Äå
This is that facility.
‚Äå
Unfortunately, I have other bad news. The season that I was there, 2010 to 2011, we converted from, uh, construction to operations and maintenance in both the elevated station and the detector array. Unfortunately, when they first fired it up, that was when we had the earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand. There was two incidental shots before they were able to target it correctly. This is an earthquake generating device as well. This is the weapons of war that we have to deal with now, and what Raytheon's hiding.
‚Äå
There's an e l F system at the South Pole Station that when I was arrived, I was told it was off dismantled and completely defunct in my work. I'll rapidly just tell you I had to figure out the circuitry for certain other repairs and I found that this system is in fact completely energized up and running and being utilized with the other systems for nefarious purposes as well. The
‚Äå
Atmospheric Research Observatory is, uh, in what we call the clean air sector. I witnessed myself a very powerful green laser shooting out of the top of this facility into the cosmos.

This, I believe, is a secondary form of long range communications and or a defense system. I am not saying that we need to be scared of anything that's out there, but please understand the military industrial complex is happy to invest all of your money in alleviating their fears.

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: What You Are About To See is EXTREMELY AGGRAVATING/UPSETTING ‚ö†Ô∏è

This Article Was Written and Sent To Me By A Maui Local Born and Raised There. He Currently Lives in Lahania and Knows Some of These Officials Personally.

When I Asked To Include His Name, He Said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want any clout. I send this out of love for Maui and its people. I hope something like this never happens again.‚Äù

As You Read This, Please Consider Sharing! All Ad Revenue From This Tweet Will Be Donated DIRECTLY (Through Local Sources) To Maui Fire Victims! WE MUST SPREAD THIS INFORMATION FAR & WIDE TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN ANYWHERE! Each Like/Retweet Equals Money Going To Families Who Need It!

HERE ARE HIS EXTREMELY POWERFUL WORDS:

‚ÄúFirst let me start off by saying Lahaina is a desert climate and has been since plantation owners rerouted the water source to other parts of the island. Lahaina used to be a lush landscape.

The infrastructure has largely remained the same since its inception. This means a cluttered nest of wires and rotting buildings. We have fires every year due to fallen electric lines. This isn‚Äôt something new.

In my opinion, this disaster could‚Äôve been completely prevented had they spent the money to upgrade to in-ground electric lines. Many have asked over the years but were told there was no funds to do it. It‚Äôs a lot easier to secure funding after a disaster.

At the very least, HECO (the electric company) could‚Äôve cut the power a lot sooner. HECO CEO Shelee Kimora claimed it could‚Äôve affected specialized medical equipment. This is crazy considering you can‚Äôt use medical equipment if it‚Äôs incinerated by a fire. Just another excuse to avoid accountability.

The state of the art ‚Äúall hazard‚Äù sirens never went off. Herman Andaya (Maui EMA director) who was in charge of making the decision to turn on the sirens said he didn‚Äôt regret it. The next day he resigned due to ‚Äúhealth issues‚Äù.

No cell service and no loudspeaker either. There was no warning of any sort. People were in their houses and completely unaware until it the fire was close. There was a fire earlier and the Maui Fire Department said it was ‚Äú100% contained‚Äù.

The police allowed incoming traffic into the town coming from Kaanapali but closed the road off on the other side due to a downed line that wasn‚Äôt even blocking the road. This caused a gridlock.

Residents' water was turned off with no way to protect their houses. Firefighters ran out of water and were denied access by Kaleo Manuel (DLNR‚Äôs deputy director for water resource management) until it was too late. This unnecessarily put firefighters at even greater risk.

I am especially embarrassed with leadership treating locals like criminals. They immediately enacted a roadblock (they could‚Äôve just closed the fire zone) and implemented a military-enforced curfew 10pm - 6pm. There has also been a near-total media block in the fire zone. This is unconstitutional!

Many residents believe they have been soft selling the body count and knew they were hundreds of bodies that they collected the first day. Most of which are likely to be children who stayed home, without any cell service or power. Rumors of them filling containers with bodies and stacking them up in non refrigerated buildings. I suspect they‚Äôre trying to keep numbers down until the news cycle is over.

Despite not providing aid themselves, they have made it incredibly hard for residents to help by blocking the wharf and turning away boats with local aid, they blocked the roads, FEMA has been confiscating pallets of aid claiming it‚Äôs not fema approved items and they are not trained to distribute them.

Maui‚Äôs Mayor Bissen has acted like a bully throughout this entire mess. Just recently he threw a fit and tried to close down the press conference after a reporter asked ‚Äúhow many children are missing?‚Äù

My elderly parents were in Maui (without cell service, water, or power) during the Lahaina fire. Next, my sister's home was initially assumed to have been lost to this weekend's terrible fires in British Columbia.

In both cases, my family members were far more fortunate than others. No one was harmed, no property was lost to fire. But it has all still been enormously stressful. 

Our world right now, is so very stressful.

We can feel helpless, not knowing what to do. We don't know how to make a difference or to help.

When we are interacting with others in crisis, there is one thing that virtually always makes a difference: showing empathy.

Just letting someone talk, and validating the difficulty of their experience goes a very long way. 

Research shows the brains of people who have been through trauma, calm down (when viewed via functional MRI scans) when someone listens to them with empathy. 

Use phrases like ""I'm so sorry, that must have been so hard"" to validate the difficulty, the suffering, and the pain, even if you personally can't relate to what has happened.

Malcolm_fleX48,1692658409000,,,,,,,"Right now there appears to be an effort to almost cover up the true magnitude of the Maui Fire Disaster and how many people may really be missing. Such is the case as it makes Biden's actions leading up to the conclusion of the disaster seem even worse in hindsight.

The Maui wildfires have claimed more lives than any other natural disaster in US history, but you wouldn‚Äôt know it from the way President Joe Biden has been acting. While hundreds of Americans burned to death and thousands more lost everything they had, Biden was busy playing golf in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and sending billions of dollars in aid and weapons to Ukraine, a country that has nothing to do with us.

Biden‚Äôs pathetic attempt to help the people of Maui is a slap in the face to every American who voted for him. He claims to care about Ukraine, which has been at war with Russia since 2022, but he doesn‚Äôt give a damn about his own country. He has asked Congress for more than $24 billion in emergency defense aid and $7.3 billion for economic and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, while offering only $700 million for disaster relief for Maui. He has also visited Ukraine twice since the Russian invasion, meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky and promising to stand by him ‚Äúas long as it takes‚Äù. In contrast, he only visited Maui once, more than a week after the fire started, and spent less than four hours on the ground.

Biden‚Äôs cold-heartedness and insensitivity to the suffering of Maui residents was obvious when he was asked about the fire during his vacation in Lake Tahoe. He gave a rude answer of ‚Äúno comment‚Äù and walked away from reporters. He also failed to address the nation or declare a national emergency until 10 days after the fire broke out. His administration has been accused of lying about the severity of the disaster and hiding crucial information from the public.

The fire, which was sparked by a lightning strike on August 8, 2023, quickly spread across the island, fueled by strong winds from Hurricane Dora and dry vegetation from years of drought. It destroyed most of the historic town of Lahaina, where 80% of the buildings were turned to dust. It also endangered rare wildlife, such as the 'akikiki bird, which has only five individuals left in the wild. The fire was finally contained on August 18, but not before it burned more than 200,000 acres and killed at least 114 people. More than 800 people are still missing and presumed dead.

The local authorities have also been slammed for their slow and ineffective response to the fire. They did not activate the early warning sirens or issue evacuation orders until it was too late for many residents to escape. They also did not request federal assistance or deploy enough firefighters and resources to fight the blaze. Some residents have accused them of covering up the true extent of the damage and the number of casualties, as well as blocking volunteers and journalists from accessing the affected areas.

Biden‚Äôs failure in Maui has reminded many people of former President George W. Bush‚Äôs blunder in Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which devastated New Orleans and other parts of Louisiana and Mississippi. Bush was widely condemned for his slow and inadequate response to the disaster, which killed more than 1,800 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. He was also criticized for flying over the disaster area in Air Force One instead of visiting it personally, and for praising his FEMA director Michael Brown, who resigned amid allegations of incompetence and corruption.

Biden‚Äôs approval rating has plummeted since the Maui fire, dropping to 38% according to a recent poll. He faces a tough re-election campaign in 2024, with former President Donald Trump leading him by 10 points in a hypothetical matchup. Trump has vowed to end the war in Ukraine and focus on domestic issues if he returns to power. He has also expressed sympathy for the victims of the Maui fire and laments the slow and lackluster response.

Biden‚Äôs failure in Maui has exposed his lack of leadership and compassion for his own people. It has also raised questions about his priorities and judgment in foreign policy.",https://twitter.com/Malcolm_fleX48/status/1693758249437172072

(a) most of Lahaina, a census designated place in Hawai‚Äôi is destroyed according to Hawaii‚Äôs Governor ‚Äî Josh Green. 

(b) 110 people have already been confirmed dead and 800 people are still missing (officials say a portion of the missing are likely dead). 

(c) the economic cost could come up to $7 billion per Moody‚Äôs Analytics. 

(d) The wildfires, which damaged more than 2,200 buildings, represent the deadliest disaster in Hawaii since a tsunami killed 61 people in 1960, a year after the islands became a US state.

Meanwhile, Biden‚Äôs first visit to Maui is today despite the fact that survivors have been asking ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the president.‚Äù  So, by ‚Äúconservatives,‚Äù ABC News must mean ‚Äúdecent human beings.‚Äù 

Federal Government Response (per article): 

‚ÄúFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said Monday her agency had distributed over $8.5 million to residents of Maui, with $3.6 million of that being for direct rental assistance, for 8,000 families that have registered for assistance.‚Äù

""We continue to have more than 1,000 federal responders on the ground and this is from dozens of federal agencies, departments and agencies."" she told reporters. ""There are 16 people that remain in shelters and we have close to 2,000 people that we have already moved into hotel rooms.""

‚ÄúCriswell said they will get an update today on what Hawaii officials believe will be the estimated time to finish searching the remaining buildings. Approximately 85% of the search area in Maui has been completed.‚Äù

‚ÄúFEMA has also made available more than 50,000 meals, 75,000 liters of water, 5,000 cots and 10,000 blankets and shelter supplies to the county government for distribution.‚Äù 

While I commend federal government officials for doing their part in the crisis and recovery response-effort, it‚Äôs also important to note that: 

Survivors, those who‚Äôve lost loved ones (family, friends) and/or those who have lost property due to the fires have publicly commented to raise concerns that go something like ‚ÄúWhy is more money being sent to Ukraine when Hawaiians ‚Ä¶. wildfire survivors ‚Ä¶ need more aid.‚Äù That is to say, comparisons are being made.

I landed very late last night, but I still got the chance to speak with some locals.

This tragedy has impacted practically EVERYONE on this island in one way or another.

I‚Äôll be meeting with locals today to try to figure out what they actually experienced on the ground and what they believed REALLY happened here.

I want to know why apparently NOBODY saw this coming.

‚Ä¢ The death toll is 100+ now and RISING
‚Ä¢ HUNDREDS more are still missing
‚Ä¢ Only FIVE PEOPLE have been identified
‚Ä¢ THOUSANDS of buildings are completely gone

So many locals have reached out directly to me here on X offering to assist me in reporting on the Lahaina fires, and I‚Äôm tremendously grateful. Keep the messages coming!

If anyone is going to get to the bottom of anything potentially nefarious going on here, it‚Äôs going to be independent journalists‚ÄîESPECIALLY on @X
